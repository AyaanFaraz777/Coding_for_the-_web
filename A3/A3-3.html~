Leon found it intriguing that there was a drug sale and had the urge to murder them. This caused panic in the crowd that was standing at the previous crime scene. The police couldnâ€™t find the suspect.</p></div><img src="Crime.jpeg"><div id="p2"><p>There was an old saint who said that there had been a demon unleashed in the town, and it possessed someone who had an impure heart. The demon had the urge to kill those at the site of a hundred feet, from the possessed. This caught the attention of the town folks who were panicked and looking for an answer to the murder going on in the town. This created a sense of relief.</p></div><div id="p3"><p>No one knew that the old saint was a fake. The boy knew this. But speared the saintâ€™s life. This was odd that the boy didnâ€™t murder the saint. This gave him a distraction to keep killing the sinners. The saint tried to keep the crowd calm and tried to explain the reasons why the demon had come to the town. The boy murderâ€™s the sinners and knows that it is all fake.</p></div><div id="crime"><img src="crime.jpeg" Alt="ðŸ˜€"><img src="criminal.jpeg" Alt="ðŸ˜ƒ"><img src="Crime scene.jpeg" Alt="ðŸ˜Š"><img src="crime scene1.jpeg" Alt="ðŸ˜‹"><img src="crime scene2.jpeg" Alt="ðŸ˜‚"></div><div id="p4"><p>But, he doesnâ€™t disclose his identity, nor does he tell about the saint to town folk. But, he wanted to see how far he would take it. The saint advised the people that had no related meaning. The saint created a fake story of a serpent and the snake as he was telling the story to the town folk. The town folk believed him not knowing that the story was fake. The saint took leverage of this to fool the town folk and got away with it easily.</p></div><a href="crime">crime</a><div id="p5"><p>The town did not have proper education and health care systems. This gave the saint leverage to fool the town folk. After two months of fooling the people. He started asking them to pay him with whatever little money they had. The next day, the town folk brought the money they had with them, after a week full of exploiting the town folk. He had learnt that the town folk were onto him. <p></div><div id="p6"><p>There was gossip about the saint. The moment Leone heard about this he got his tools and his hood killed the saint and returned all the wealth to all the people anonymously this opened their eyes to what was in front of them. This created intense discussions among the town folk. This kept growing day by day as this intensified they kept on reoccurring with the same topic.</p></div><div id="p7"><p>This caused a lot of people to believe that it was a miracle that it happened. They didnâ€™t believe the fact that it was a person this caused it to become intense many of them did not want to find out who was responsible for the anonymous money they received after the Saint had been killed. This caused the police to keep trying to find who the culprit was.</p></div><div id="p8"><p>The culprit was one of the policeman who had been helping the boy who used to kill the sinners which were very evident in this case as this turns out to be the blood of the killer. However, they did not have the equipment to test the DNA of the killer. They were not advanced enough to test for a DNA match. So, they sent the sample of blood to the nearest city Wien Bay City. This caused people to feel of the city and not the town. When the townâ€™s folk heard about this, some started to migrate to the city from the town.</p></div><div id="p9"><p>The town folk who migrated from the town took up odd jobs to sustain themselves in the city, Some took jobs in the factories, railways, bus stops, etc. This started a sense of independence, which was new to this. They did not know how it felt like to be themselves to be independent and to do things by themselves self whereas the town used to have people to trust.</p></div><div id="p10"><p>They were treated badly in many areas. When the town folk moved to the city, they were given faces of awe, hate and cruelty towards them. Some of the townspeople wanted to move back to the town. This led to the emergence of Leone. He went and murdered the owner of the factory, people who gave hate comments at the bus stop towards the town folk. Then he drugged the railway conductor who was known for exploitation of the people of Dexter city and migrant labourers.</p></div><div id="p11"><p>The next day, the town folk of the dexter city were free from the exploitation of the people and were happy about it! The town folk were very excited but it was short-lived. After new factories were set up in the Trimester city. Then the town folk of Dexter city were forced to work in the factories as cheap labour. This caused the growth of Trimester City and the downfall of Dexter City. This then kept getting worse. Until Leone started killing the exploiters again. The townspeople learnt that if they kept quiet then they would never get out of exploitation. </p></div><a href="A3-4.html"> Next chapter</a></body></html>
