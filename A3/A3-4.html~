They were tall, well-built, robust and frightening. The serpents were in huge numbers and difficult to negotiate with. Whereas the drug piper had taken over the south side of Dexter City which had been abandoned for more than three years this caused distress among the town folk who migrated to the city and went back to the town. But, they were killed even before they could even reach their destination.</p></div><div id="p2"><p>Some of the town folk succumbed to their fate in the city. The town folk who now live in the city now lost their ability to fight for their human rights. Now they want to become dependent on the employers for their jobs even though it was low paid which barely gave them the capacity to afford their necessities. They had to do two jobs just to make ends meet. They were tired overworked and unhappy. This went on for a prolonged period. </p></div><div id="p3"><p>This caused unrest in the town of Dexter city, as the violence spread at the rate at which had become uncontrollable. This used to become war in that particular area which would disrupt Trimester City. The mayor of Trimester City tried to control the violence on the border that faces Dexter City. The mayor was unsuccessful in the attempt. But, the people hated each other and a civil war started which also adversely on the Trimester City. This caused food shortages, and the price of living standards increased. So much so that there were more people on the streets. This caused unrest and higher dependence on villages that were facing the north side of the city to provide food for the hungry, the homeless and the factory workers along with the residents of the city. This caused people who were working in the factories were have a harder time making ends meet.</p></div><div id="crime"><img src="crime.jpeg" Alt="ðŸ˜€"><img src="criminal.jpeg" Alt="ðŸ˜ƒ"><img src="Crime scene.jpeg" Alt="ðŸ˜Š"><img src="crime scene1.jpeg" Alt="ðŸ˜‹"><img src="crime scene2.jpeg" Alt="ðŸ˜‚"></div><a href="#crime">crime</a><div id="p4"><p>Then the news spread to far-off cities where the residents of trimester cities started migrating to the far-off cities where the demand for factory labour was the highest. The residents of Trimester City are starting to migrate as they were not able to make ends meet. They were not able even put food on the table, to put a roof over their heads as the prices increased so drastically that the locals of Trimester City were not able to afford to spend. This caused the locals of the city to transition into a dreamer city.</p><div id="p5"><p>The locals of Dreamer City were peaceful, charming, diligent and hard-working. There was no pressure towards the factory workers there was no oppression from the owners and the pay was better than Trimester City where the factory workers earned fifty euros an hour which was reasonable pay according to the standard of living which was a step up from the Trimester City. Which made the people relieved from oppression. However, some of them were unaware of the cityâ€™s night safety level in the city which caused them a lot of difficulties as they were made to work from 7 am to 7 pm by the time they left the factory. They are faced with muggers, thieves and murderers. Roam around the street at night.</p></div><div id="p6"><p>Then Leone shows up and kills the sinners such as muggers, thieves and murderers on some parts of the streets or in shady parts of the city. Some people used to live in those parts of the city. Which was not a good system in which they stayed indoors and the windows were closed. They lived in the fear of getting mugged, and robbed. This caused a sense of insecurity among themselves because of this the locals of Dreamer City were used to this and also knew how to deal with it. However, the locals of the Trimester City were new to these concepts. As it was their first time hearing about the stuff that was going around.</p></div><div id="p7"><p>Then Leone shows up and kills the sinners such as muggers, thieves and murderers on some parts of the streets or in shady parts of the city.

However, the locals of the Trimester City were new to these concepts. As it was their first time hearing about the stuff that was going around.</p><div id="p8"><p>There was a law that was passed that stated that the locals of Trimester Cityâ€”had to live next to the locals who had been living in Dreamer City. The locals were encouraged to help the locals who had come from Dreamer City to Trimester City. There were programs organised by the mayor to create awareness on how to safeguard themselves against the crimes that take place in the Dreamer City.On the day of the program, the mayor was receiving threats about being murdered during the conference that had happened. There was tight security for the mayor. This ensured that the mayor was safe in the conference as he was not safe. A sniper was standing on a building and aiming at the mayor. But, he missed the mayor and went and hit the car behind him. This started to cause panic among the people.</p></div><div id="p9"><p>The arena where the conference was held turned into a crime scene. The police blocked the people from entering the scene except the ambulance. The mayor was safe because he had well-trained armed security and police at the site to protect against the death threats from one of the protesters. The police have no clue or trace against the criminal.</p></div><div id="p10"><p>This caused more murders and many more death threats. This made it more complicated to solve by the police the tier 2 agents had to get involved in this case. They headed to the crime scene to find something that the police missed, and they found a hair which was sent to the forensics lab at Quantico a place in America where they could test and find out who the murderer was. But, they end up in the dead end as the hair belonged to a goat that was passing by the street. There were several phone calls to the police stating a murder. There the second set of phones rang with calls related to rape or sexual assault. There was the third set of phones which rang with phones related to suicides. The fourth set of phones related to murder and cannibalisation.</p></div><div id="p11"><p>The next month, an inspection was done by the highest agency in the country and they saw that there were 2100 unsolved cases. This is a bad record for the police station as having more than 100 cases unsolved is considered a very bad record. The Internal Affairs department was informed about these cases They decided to review the sheriffâ€™s effectiveness in the department. As most of the cases were unsolved.</p></div><div id="p12"><p>One the sheriff of the county, was asked to appear before the board of criminal activities against the sheriff. If the sheriff is unable to solve the crimes. Then he was asked to quit the police force. But, there was no lead against the cases was a dead end as the sheriff had no way to stop the criminals from committing the crime. But, the crime kept growing and there was no evidence to support the crime. </p></div><a href="A3-5.html"> Next chapter</a></body></html>
