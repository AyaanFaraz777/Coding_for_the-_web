Does this count as spam? 2. Is there someplace I should report this, or should I fix it myself? 3. Should I be more aggressive, pointing out that the same user has been doing similar spammy stuff for a couple of months or more, and take it upon myself to delete all of the other spammy links this user has added?

Shantavira|feed me 08:34, 13 October 2023 (UTC)[reply]In the last few weeks I have been creating or expanding articles on "education in xxx" where xxx is a US state or major city. School segregation is a major subtheme and I have found the book "Historical Dictionary of School Segregation and Desegregation: The American Experience" is a very useful scholarly reference. See online copy Its author Jeffrey Raffel is a well-regarded professor at the U of Delaware; we have never been in contact in any way. I have zero connection or conflict of interest to any of these "Education in xxx" articles or to any of the scholarly books and articles in the "Further reading." I have followed the rules regarding spam especially: " Spam is the inappropriate addition of content to Wikipedia with the intention of promoting or publicizing an outside organization, individual or idea." Rjensen (talk) 15:03, 13 October 2023 (UTC)[reply]WP:Spam#External link spamming provides a more nuanced interpretation of the situation, e.g. repeatedly adding links will in most cases result in all of them being removed. Of course, I'm not alleging that you're obtaining any sort of personal gain or advantage, but adding links to as many articles as you can rationalize is maybe somewhat counterproductive. FWIW, this was already included in Bibliography of the history of education in the United States.</p><p>While this source can surely be a helpful for relevant content, that can probably be said about hundreds of other sources, and it may be better or worse than those other sources. It just seems to be that one of the "themes" regarding "further reading", "bibliographies", and the like is that we should avoid overdoing it. If we really want to have extensive bibliographies, then I'm fine with that, but our policy ought to clearly reflect that.After working with that book I concluded it was the single best source available for our readers on the topic of school segregation at the local level. So I added it to the numerous articles dealing with racial segregation. In university history classes (and in many high schools) the students have to write research papers, and many turn to Wikipedia for help in finding useful sources. Professors do not want them to depend on the text in Wiki articles, but they do encourage them to use our bibliographies. I had those students in mind. If instead they go to Google Scholar, they will find over 600,000 links! listed here As for my academic experience in making judgments about the usefulness of history books see Richard J. Jensen. Back in the 1970s I had major grants from the National Institute of Education to study the history of education in USA; to this day I try to follow the academic literature on that topic. Rjensen (talk) 22:50, 13 October 2023 I hope you won't take this the wrong way, but there's a school of thought that someone who's an expert in a particular field is unlikely to be neutral about that subject. One who fancies themself as an expert in English mechanics is likely to have a strong opinion about the Oxford comma. I suppose I should give you credit for not suggesting that we actually should be targeting for the 600,000 link bibliography that Google Scholar would provide. Fabrickator (talk) 07:50, 14 October 2023</p><p>Am I neutral about education? No I'm in favor of it. How about you? Rjensen Neutral, in the context of the WP:NPOV, doesn't mean that you have no opinion, but that you can maintain a "neutral" perspective on it. There are so many pertinent sources to incorporate in a bibliography related to school segregation and desegregation. Better to have sources that will cover the topic broadly, or should the emphasis be on sources that go into greater depth? Perhaps there is a place for both. In any case, WP guidance generally suggests to be managing the size of bibliographies. I merely suggest that the goal of the "encyclopedia" is better served by including the reference to this "dictionary" in the most general of related articles, while including sources that are more directly related in articles which are more focused.
