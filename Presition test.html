He has been dubbed "the most prominent Montenegrin historian" of events in Montenegro during World War II by the Montenegrin historian Srƒëa Pavloviƒá, and Professor Kenneth Morrison, author of the 2009 book Montenegro: A Modern History, asserts that Pajoviƒá is one of the most prominent Montenegrin historians in general.</p><p>Pajoviƒá received the "13 July Award" from the National Assembly of Montenegro and the "19 December Award" from the city of Titograd, the capital of Montenegro. His most notable works were Kontrarevolucija u Crnoj Gori: ƒçetniƒçki i federalistiƒçki pokret 1941‚Äì1945 [Counterrevolution in Montenegro: The Chetnik and Federalist Movements 1941‚Äì1945], published in 1977; Pavle ƒêuri≈°iƒá: kontroverzni ƒçetniƒçki vojvoda [Pavle ƒêuri≈°iƒá: Controversial Chetnik Duke], first published in 1987 and then supplemented and expanded and re-published in 2005; and Crna Gora kroz istoriju [Montenegro Through History], also published in 2005. He was the author or co-author of twelve books and the editor of more than twenty, and he published around one hundred articles and other contributions. In the 1990s, some historians attempted to rehabilitate the World War II Chetniks who collaborated with the Axis powers, and Pajoviƒá was among the historians who opposed this politically motivated historical revisionism. Towards the end of his academic career and in retirement, Pajoviƒá was a vocal advocate for Montenegrin independence and identity.</p><img src="Radoje_PajovicÃÅ.jpg" alt="ü§ë"></div><Br><div id="In_the_news"><p>This page provides a forum for editors to suggest items for inclusion on In the news (ITN), a protected template on the Main Page, as well as the forum for discussion of candidates.
